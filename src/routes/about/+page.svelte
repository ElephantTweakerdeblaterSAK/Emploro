			At Emploro I give absolute commitment to PC tweaking. I started with game development. At the
			time our focus was on building an open-world game. I got a successor to my old laptop which
			happened to be more sluggish than my predecessor. That's when I started my PC tweaking
			journey. I learned by watching PC tweaking videos at the time I didn't have a proper testing
			method causing me not to know that I had a placebo. I started with basic tweaking, I ended up
			finding tweaks that made improvements to my performance. I wasn't a professional tweaker at
			the time. My PC tweaking substantically changed 2 years ago. I got my first gaming laptop with
			a dedicated GPU (MSI gf65 thin 10ue 092.) The laptop was underperforming. Other RTX 3060
			laptops seemed to have much more performance. The tweaks that I was knowledgeable about at the
			time did not make much difference to my performance. My hypothesis was the fact it had a
			substantially lower amount of watts going to the GPU than other Rtx 3060 laptops. When I
			connected my laptop to an external display specifically a TV there was noticeable stuttering.
			I embarked on a discovery. My integrated GPU in the device manager. My performance was
			substantially better. I reverted to defaults causing my performance to go back down. I learned
			Nvidia Optimus was the cause of the sluggish performance. The device manager method partially
			disabled the Nvidia Optimus. It was not doable as it removed my display's refresh rate. I
			embarked on making a driver that would bypass Nvidia Optimus. I had thought it worked as my
			performance seemed higher after comparing it to Nvidia Optimus being fully bypassed, but
			disabling it was not. I discovered if I connected my laptop to the display and disabled the
			laptop display I'd get drastic improvements. I became knowledgeable about Nvidia Optimus. I
			also now know that Nvidia Optimus cannot be disabled in software with a mux switch or advanced
			Nvidia Optimus as your device is wired to the integrated. I had found my laptop to be thermal
			throttling. When I would play games for a duration of 3 minutes on the first boot my
			performance would be much better. I got an IETs GT500 5000 rpm cooling pad. I committed to
			making specialized tweak packs for Windows. I didn't realize my testing method was improper.
			This led to lots of placebos. There were drastic performance improvements though. A Tweaking
			company favorite of mine Hone. Made jokes about Emploro Ultimate as it didn't tweak properly
			and wasn't intended to be used without the tweak pack. Emploro Ultimate had an improperly
			tested tweak known as HPET (High Precision event timer.) After all of this, I mistakenly added
			my Roblox optimization pack to my public folder this update was intended to improve my tweaks
			pack issue with sluggish performance on Roblox. I've been working since March of 2023 on
			Emploro Labs. Emploro Labs embarks on massively improved performance. Much later in my
			journey, I got busy on a private project. During my private project, Kyro an amazing PC
			tweaker agreed to partner up. I wanted to help him improve his tweaks at the time. Lots of
			people told me my grammar was improper and lots of rudeness was spread. This made me a better
			tweaker as I moved away from my old habits and became much better. I enforced a testing policy
			to ensure accurate testing of each tweak. This would as ensure my app wouldn't have any
			placebo. I finished the private project. After I started my journey of bios tweaks. I started
			with SCEWIN also Known as AMISCE. SCEWIN/AMISCE would say successful when I exported my bios
			but the file would appear blank. This was strange as I have an AMI motherboard. I joined
			AMIT's PC tuning server. I wanted to ask his team exactly why this would happen. AMIT referred
			me to Abel (full GitHub name ab3lkaizen.) Abel had told me that I may have had an error not
			showing up and thought I would need to flash my bios. I asked him if it affected performance
			as I wanted to use stock configurations first testing I didn't communicate well and AMIT and
			people on his server said rude things. AMIT said the more I talk the dumber I look. One guy
			sent a link and it was a video where I said to disable the High-precision event timer. I told
			them I didn't test this and AMIT told me to get out of the server. I told them it was old when
			they looked it said August I thought that was considered a long time ago they banned me for
			misinformation and trusting catbutter09 a PC tweak tester. MMUNK the creator of VTRL my main
			competitor said I should join his team and now I will extensively learn to blow away and
			tweaker besides me also helping others. See you on the website.
